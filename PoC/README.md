#### Start docker compose

To start the `docker compose`, simply run configuration for IntelliJ `kafka-poc-docker` or

```

#### Data transfer

In [bruno collection](kafka-pull/collections/Kafka%20PoC%20Bruno%20collection)
all HTTP requests required to run kafka pull transfers are prepared.
Using these requests, Alice will act as the provider and Bob will act as the consumer.

Run these requests on provider side:

- Create asset
- Create Contract definition
- Create policy

Then run these requests on consumer side:

- Get dataset
- Initiate Negotiation
- Get Negotiation
- Kafka PULL
- Get transfer process

After initiating the Kafka pull transfer, the Kafka Consumer App wil automatically pick up the EDR and connect to the Kafka Broker.

### DataAddress Schema

Information about `kafka-broker-extension` could be found in [README.md](kafka-pull/README.md)
