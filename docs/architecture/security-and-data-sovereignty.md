# Secure and Sovereign Data Exchange: Implementing Strategic Requirements with Tractus-X Kafka Extension

## Introduction

This document details the implementation of strategic non-functional requirements related to Security and Data Sovereignty within the Tractus-X EDC Kafka Extension. It explains the mechanisms, roles, responsibilities, and provides practical examples to ensure robust data security, controlled data access, and comprehensive data sovereignty.

## 1. Traceable Data Flow

### 1.1 Data Consumption Control

The Tractus-X EDC Kafka Extension offers comprehensive mechanisms for data providers to control data access:

- **Contract Negotiation**: Providers define usage policies via contracts specifying the conditions for accessing Kafka topics.
- **Dynamic Credential Provisioning**: Credentials are dynamically generated upon consumer data transfer requests.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: OAuth scopes are mapped to Kafka ACLs to grant precise topic access.
- **Token-Based Authorization**: OAuth tokens control Kafka topic access with clearly defined scopes and expiration times.

### 1.2 Access Revocation

The procedure for revoking consumer access includes:

1. **Suspend/Terminate Transfer**: Provider initiates suspension or termination via Control Plane.
2. **Token Revocation**: Kafka Extension instructs Data Plane and OAuth Service to revoke tokens.
3. **Access Termination**: OAuth Service confirmation ceases consumer access.

### 1.3 Component Responsibilities

Explicit responsibilities for data flow control:

- **Control Plane**: Manages negotiations, policy compliance, and interaction with Kafka Extension.
- **Kafka Extension**: Coordinates credential management between Control and Data Planes.
- **OAuth Service**: Handles dynamic client registrations, token lifecycle management.
- **Vault**: Securely stores authentication credentials and secrets.

## 2. Token Management

### 2.1 Token Roles

Tokens utilized by the Kafka extension:

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWT tokens facilitating immediate Kafka topic access.

### 2.2 Token Lifecycle

Scenarios managed by token lifecycle processes:

- **Normal Expiration**: Automated token refresh prior to expiration.
- **Forced Revocation**: Immediate token revocation capability.
- **Failed Refresh**: Consumer access terminated upon token refresh failure.

### 2.3 Asset Role

- The **Kafka topic** is the negotiated asset, not individual records.
- Topic-level negotiation and access control.
- Consumers access all messages published during token validity.

## 3. Security Measures

### 3.1 Security Protocols

Kafka Extension security protocols include:

- **Transport Encryption**: Secure communications using TLS/SSL (SASL_SSL protocol).
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 tokens via SASL/OAUTHBEARER.
- **Authorization**: Comprehensive authorization via EDC policies, Kafka ACLs, and OAuth scopes.

### 3.2 Protection Against Unauthorized Access

Security features preventing unauthorized access:

- **Dynamic Credentials**: Temporary, single-use credentials.
- **Short-lived Tokens**: Reducing potential misuse windows.
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials managed securely in Vault.
- **Token Validation**: OAuth Service token validation prior to Kafka access.

## 4. Self-Sovereign Data Sharing

### 4.1 Autonomous Control

Providers maintain full autonomous control over data sharing:

- **Policy Definition**: Customizable data access policies.
- **Dynamic Management**: Real-time policy enforcement via Control Plane.
- **Data Residency**: Data remains on provider infrastructure, access-only model.
- **Contractual Governance**: Data access governed by explicitly negotiated contracts.

### 4.2 Granular Access Control

Fine-grained access capabilities provided by the Kafka Extension include:

- Controlled visibility of contract offers.
- Varied policy applications to assets.
- Topic-policy mapping with precise constraints.

### 4.3 Data Sovereignty Scenarios

Illustrative scenarios demonstrating data sovereignty:

1. **Time-Limited Access:**  
   Defined duration access, automatically terminated post-expiration.

2. **Purpose-Specific Access:**  
   Explicit use-case limitations such as quality assurance only.

3. **Selective Revocation:**  
   Immediate revocation for misuse incidents without wider service impact.

4. **Auditability:**  
   Complete records of negotiation and data transfers for compliance verification.

5. **Differentiated Access Levels:**  
   Persistent policies for long-term customers. Short-term revocable policies for consultants and auditors.

## Conclusion

The Tractus-X EDC Kafka Extension integrates robust security measures and comprehensive data sovereignty controls, enabling data providers to securely manage and share real-time data while maintaining full governance over their assets.
