## Problem Statement

The Tractus-X EDC currently lacks a dedicated, real-time data streaming mechanism that enables continuous, event-driven
communication between data providers and consumers. This Proof of Concept (POC) integrates Apache Kafka as a
decentralized component on the provider side, operating behind the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) to evaluate a
publish/subscribe-based streaming solution that facilitates real-time machine and production data exchange on the
automotive shopfloor, thereby evaluating the necessary protocol extensions, integration challenges, and risks before
full-scale adoption.

## Example

Consider an automotive shopfloor where production machines continuously generate data on operational status,
performance metrics, and production counts. Each company retains control over its own data sink and connects it to the
Tractus-X network via the Eclipse Dataspace Connector, preserving data sovereignty. Within this framework, a
decentralized Kafka Broker and Kafka Provider at the provider’s site manage the real-time publication of data, published
as EDC Offer, while on the consumer side, individual Kafka Consumers consume the Offer, subscribe to the data stream to
trigger immediate alerts and enable dynamic adjustments in production processes, thereby optimizing efficiency and
reducing downtime.

## Architectural Overview

### Key Components

The architecture is divided into three principal areas: the Provider ecosystem, the Provider cluster, and the Consumer
ecosystem/cluster. The PlantUML component diagram explicitly illustrates these divisions:

- **Provider Ecosystem:**
    - **Provider Application:** Initiates the data production process by sending a stream of data to Kafka through a
      dedicated Producer API.

- **Provider Cluster:**
    - **Control Plane:** Orchestrates the transfer by managing negotiation, policy checks, and interaction with the
      Kafka Extension.
    - **Data Plane:** Implements the runtime data transfer logic, including token renewal and DataAddress generation.
    - **Kafka Extension:**
        - Acts as the mediator between the control and Data Planes.
        - Orchestrates dynamic credential provisioning/deprovisioning.
        - Communicates with the OAuth Service via an OAuth Management API for creating, renewing, and revoking tokens.
        - Reads from and writes to a secure Vault where temporary credentials are stored.
    - **Kafka Service:** Provides the underlying messaging platform. It enforces authentication (via
      SASL/OAUTHBEARER) and authorization on topics.
    - **OAuth Service:**
        - Handles dynamic client registration and token management.
        - Issues access and refresh tokens.
    - **Vault:** Secure repository for storing temporary credentials and secrets.
    - **OAuth Manage API:** The interface through which the Kafka Extension and Data Plane manage dynamic OAuth
      credentials.
- **Consumer Ecosystem/Cluster:**
    - **Consumer Application:** Consumes data by subscribing to the Kafka topic.
    - **Consumer Control Plane:** Initiates data transfer requests and receives the Endpoint Data Reference (EDR)
      necessary to create a secure connection to Kafka.
    - **Consumer API (via Kafka Consumer):** Directly interacts with the Kafka Service to poll data once authenticated.

## Workflow and Process Phases

The system processes are defined by four key phases. Each phase is illustrated by its corresponding sequence diagram,
which provides a step-by-step message flow.

### A. Provisioning/Deprovisioning Phase

**Purpose:** Securely create or delete consumer credentials.

**Flow:**

1. **Provisioning:**
    - The **Consumer Control Plane** sends a **TransferRequestMessage** to the **Provider Control Plane**.
    - The **Provider Control Plane** forwards a **ProvisionRequest** to the **Kafka Extension**.
    - The **Kafka Extension** calls the **OAuth Service** to create new credentials.
    - Once credentials are issued, the Kafka Extension saves them securely in the Vault.
    - A **ProvisionResponse** is then returned from the Kafka Extension up through the Provider Control Plane back to
      the Consumer.
2. **Deprovisioning:**
    - When the transfer concludes, the **Provider Control Plane** issues a **DeprovisionRequest** to the Kafka
      Extension.
    - The Kafka Extension instructs the **OAuth Service** to delete the credentials.
    - After credential deletion, the Kafka Extension clears the corresponding entries from the Vault and returns a *
      *DeprovisionResponse**.

![Sequence diagram EDC Kafka Extension provisioning-deprovisioning.png](/docs/concepts/MVP-kafka-pull/png/Sequence%20diagram%20EDC%20Kafka%20Extension%20provisioning-deprovisioning.png)

### B. Initiating the Transfer

**Purpose:** Initiate a transfer process with dynamic credentials and EDR creation.

**Flow:**

1. **Start Transfer Request:**
    - The **Consumer Control Plane** instructs the **Provider Control Plane** to start the transfer process.
    - The Provider Control Plane performs policy and contract verification.
2. **DataFlowRequest:**
    - The Provider Control Plane sends a **DataFlowRequest** to the Kafka Extension.
    - The Kafka Extension retrieves credentials from the Vault.
    - It then communicates with the **Data Plane** to initiate the transfer.
    - The Data Plane contacts the **OAuth Service** to generate both an access token and a refresh token.
    - After token generation, the Data Plane creates a **DataAddress** containing necessary connection details (such as
      topic, poll duration, OAuth token, and groupPrefix).
    - A **DataFlowResponse** message is returned to the Kafka Extension, which adjusts the DataAddress if needed and
      passes it back to the Provider Control Plane.
    - Finally, the Provider Control Plane sends a **TransferStartMessage** (attached with the complete DataAddress) to
      the Consumer Control Plane.
    - The Consumer Control Plane then constructs the final Endpoint Data Reference (EDR) for use by the consumer
      application.

![Sequence diagram EDC Kafka Extension start transfer process.png](/docs/concepts/MVP-kafka-pull/png/Sequence%20diagram%20EDC%20Kafka%20Extension%20start%20transfer%20process.png)

### C. Data Streaming Phase

**Purpose:** Establish a secure, token-based data stream between the consumer and Kafka Service.

**Flow:**

1. **EDR Request and Authentication:**
    - The **Consumer Application** requests an EDR from the **Consumer Control Plane**.
    - Upon receipt of the EDR, the Consumer Application uses it to instantiate a Kafka Consumer.
    - The consumer then initiates authentication with the **Kafka Service**.
    - The Kafka Service, in turn, verifies the token by communicating with the **OAuth Service**.
    - After successful authentication, the consumer begins polling the Kafka Service for data messages.
2. **Continuous Data Polling:**
    - As long as the token remains valid, the consumer continuously polls and processes data messages from the Kafka
      Service.
    - The token’s life-cycle is managed automatically via one of the configured refresh strategies.

![Sequence diagram EDC Kafka Extension data streaming.png](/docs/concepts/MVP-kafka-pull/png/Sequence%20diagram%20EDC%20Kafka%20Extension%20data%20streaming.png)

### D. Suspending/Terminating the Transfer

**Purpose:** Securely suspend or terminate data transfer by revoking consumer credentials.

**Flow:**

1. Initiation of Termination:
    - The Provider Control Plane sends a Suspend/Terminate Message to the Kafka Extension.
2. Token Revocation:
    - The Kafka Extension forwards a revoke token instruction to the Data Plane.
    - The Data Plane then contacts the OAuth Service to revoke the tokens.
    - Once the OAuth Service confirms revocation, the Data Plane notifies the Kafka Extension.
    - The Kafka Service is informed, ensuring that polling stops for the revoked token, and the overall termination is
      acknowledged back to the Provider Control Plane.
    - Finally, the Consumer Control Plane is informed that the transfer has been suspended or terminated.

![Sequence diagram EDC Kafka Extension suspending-terminating.png](/docs/concepts/MVP-kafka-pull/png/Sequence%20diagram%20EDC%20Kafka%20Extension%20suspending-terminating.png)

## Security and Token Management

### Token Creation and Expiration

- **Dynamic Token Issuance:**
  The OAuth Service provides short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens using SASL/OAUTHBEARER. These tokens guarantee
  that any consumer’s access is temporary and can be refreshed or revoked as needed.
- **Secure Vault Storage:**
  All dynamically issued credentials are saved within a secure Vault by the Kafka Extension. This allows both safe
  retrieval during transfer start and secure cleanup upon transfer termination.

### Token Refresh Strategies

The design supports various token refresh strategies:

- Automatic Refresh via Consumer Data Plane:
  Proactively refresh tokens before they expire.
- Automatic Refresh via the EDR API (/edrs):
  The Provider Control Plane can handle token refresh operations when needed.
- Manual Refresh:
  The consumer application can trigger token refresh operations if required.

These strategies ensure that the system can maintain uninterrupted data flow while complying with dynamic security
policies.

See
the [Tractus-X EDC Signaling Extension](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/blob/main/docs/development/dataplane-signaling/tx-signaling.extensions.md)
for more details.

## Interoperability

The Kafka Extension does not change anything related to IATP, DSP and policy definitions. This ensures full
conformity to the
Standard [CX-0018 Dataspace Connectivity v.3.1.0](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0018-DataspaceConnectivity)
for chapters 2.1, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.

Since the Kafka PULL extension will introduce the new transfer type `Kafka-PULL` the standard has to be extended by this
new type once the extension exits POC state and is introduced as a proper Tractus-X EDC extension.

An example for the extended standard could be:

> 2.2.3 Kafka-PULL
>
> A Consumer MUST send a `dspace:TransferRequestMessage` with `dct:format:dspace:Kafka-PULL`.
>
> A Provider MUST send a `dspace:TransferStartMessage` with sufficient information in the
`dspace:dataAddress` property so that a client connection to the
`dspace:endpoint` may succeed when initialized with the properties `scopes`, `groupPrefix` and `topic`.
>
> A Provider Connector MUST ensure that the requested backend system has sufficient context from the negotiation to evaluate the legitimacy of the request.
>
> A Consumer may then use the provided data to execute requests against the endpoint.
>
> Despite the token, the endpoint still has the right to refuse serving a request. This may occur for instance when a consumer attempts to request for a different topic than the one specified in the
`dspace:dataAddress`.

To be in line with the EDC development best-practices,
the [Contrubutors Manual](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/documentation/for-contributors/) has to be understood.

## Enhancements Over the Existing POC

The revised design improves upon the initial proof-of-concept by incorporating:

- **Dynamic Credential Management:** Replacing hard-coded credentials with OAuth-driven dynamic client registration and
  token management.
- **Robust Security and Token Lifecycle:** Implementing short-lived tokens with secure vault storage and supporting
  multiple token refresh strategies, thereby reducing exposure risks.
